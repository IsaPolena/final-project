Corpus Processing (A Saga of Struggle): 

Step 1: Convert files from original format to csv file.
         Problem 1.1-- The original corpus was formatted in an unusable way. The delimiter was set as '+++$+++' and was thus virtually unreadable by any program. 
        Solution 1.1-- Used TextEdit application to open original files and individually edit using the search/replace function, effectively rendering each file in a csv format.
                        --> All instances of '+++$+++' were found and replaced by commas.
                        --> Spaces were also removed in this way to facilitate csv use in python
         Problem 1.2-- Some commas were present in the data and were interpretted as delimiters, incorrrectly breaking up data set.
        Solution 1.2-- Repeat solution 1.1 with an added step.
                       --> First find/replace all existing commas had to be found and replaced with a space, then proceed with S1.1.
         Problem 1.3-- Changing file names from txt. to csv. format.
        Solution 1.3-- Literally just changed document names so they were read in the form of csv.

Step 2: Upload Files to spreadsheet software.
        Problem 2.1-- Some files were too large to upload to Google Sheets.
        Solution 2.1-- Used computer terminal to split said files into smaller sections.
                       --> Then uploaded segments individually.
         Problem 2.2-- Google Sheets was overloaded and incredibly slow (when it didn't just outright freeze) when more than one sheet was being edited.
        Solution 2.2-- Split every file into its own page and worked on one at a time.
         Problem 2.3-- Still worked like garbage.
        Solution 2.3-- Switched to excel and started process over.
        
Step 3: Remove unnecessary data columns from corpus.
        --> Some data in the corpus is not relevant to our current project, and can therefore removed from our dataset.
        Problem 3.1-- When using excel online, files are automatically converted to xlsx. format.
                       --> This is a format that neither my computer/applications nor replit can read.
        Solution 3.1-- ???
                       --> Ended up just uploading untrimmed csv. files to replit in hopes of editing there.
         Problem 3.2-- Figuring out how to trim data using python
        Solution 3.2-- Using .drop function in pandas to removed unnecessary columns
                      --> See CorpusEdit.py
