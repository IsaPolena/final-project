They test movie screenplays from the Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDB) with the three criteria of the Bechdel Test. They go through the steps of how they determine how a movie screenplay passes or fails the Bechdel Test and the importance of women’s roles in these movies. 

Fogel, Joshua, and Kara Criscione. "Passing the Bechdel Test and the Influence of Internet and Social Media Advertising on Seeing a New Movie Release." International Journal of Arts Management 22.3 (2020). (on the pdf pages 69-79)

They survey people to ask that if a movie passing the Bechdel Test is important. In the survey, they include the importance of age and race/ethnicity of these women roles. Not directly related to our project but it’s still interesting how they used the Bechdel Test for the importance of advertising a movie.


Bouchat, Kathryn Gray. "Testing the Bechdel Test." (2019).

She tests the Bechdel Test and how progressive it actually is. It compares two Netflix original movies, Kissing Booth and Sierra Burgess is a Loser, where one passes the Bechdel Test and one doesn’t versus how progressive each movie is towards feminism.
